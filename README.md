# DepDetect

**DepDetect** is a Python-based machine learning application created as a final project for my 3rd Year Elective Course. The application predicts depression in adults aged 25 to 50 by analyzing various behavioral and emotional factors using the XGBoost algorithm.

## How to Use

1. Download the DepDetect files from this repository.
2. Extract the downloaded files.
3. Double-click on `DepDetect.exe` to run the application.

## Dataset
